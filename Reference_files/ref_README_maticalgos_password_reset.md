# Password Reset Script for Maticalgos

This script is designed to handle password reset and login operations for the Maticalgos platform. It utilizes the `historical` module from the `maticalgos` package to perform these operations.

## Process Flow

1. **Import Necessary Modules**:
   - The script begins by importing the `logging` module for logging operations and the `historical` class from the `maticalgos.historical` module.

2. **Logging Configuration**:
   - Logging is configured to display messages at the `INFO` level or higher. The log format includes the timestamp, log level, and message.

3. **Initialize Historical Object**:
   - An instance of the `historical` class is created using the email `jtutanota@gmail.com`. This object (`ma`) is used to interact with the Maticalgos platform.

4. **Password Reset (Commented Out)**:
   - The script contains a commented-out line `ma.reset_password()`, which suggests that the script can reset the password if needed. Uncommenting this line would trigger the password reset process.

5. **Login Attempt**:
   - The script attempts to log in using a password or code (`"965124"`). This is done within a `try` block to handle potential exceptions.
   - If the login is successful, an informational log message is recorded.
   - If the login fails, an error log message is recorded with the exception details.

## Logic Overview

- **Logging**: The script uses Python's built-in logging module to provide feedback on the login process. This helps in tracking the success or failure of operations.
  
- **Historical Class**: The `historical` class from the `maticalgos` package is central to the script's functionality. It likely provides methods for user authentication and password management.

- **Exception Handling**: The script uses a `try-except` block to manage exceptions during the login process, ensuring that errors are logged and do not cause the script to crash unexpectedly.

## Usage

- To reset the password, uncomment the `ma.reset_password()` line.
- Ensure that the correct login credentials are provided in the `ma.login()` method.
- Run the script to perform the login operation and check the logs for success or failure messages.

## Note

- The email and password/code used in the script are placeholders and should be replaced with actual credentials for real-world use.
- Ensure that the `maticalgos` package is installed and properly configured in your environment.
